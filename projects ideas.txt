1. Social Media App
Future of Social Media Marketing in India is amazing as Social media apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter, are prime examples of sophisticated apps. These apps can be a great inspiration for a React project since they have an ever-increasing number of advanced features. The best part about building a social media app using React is that you know what kind of features you must include in the app. Some of the most common features of almost all social media apps are: 

User authentication
Notification and newsfeed
Easy integration with other platforms
Posting, sharing, and commenting
Basically, a social media app provides you ample scope for experimentation. After adding the most basic features (as the ones mentioned above), you can create additional features for customization that will allow end-users to tweak their profiles and accounts according to their requirements and preferences. 

Technologies you can use: 

Create React App or React Native for creating dynamic UI for posts, messages, and likes.
AWS Amplify, or Firebase, or Hasura (using GraphQL subscriptions) for real-time data. 
AWS Lambda or Firebase Functions for app notifications
Firebase or Cloudinary storage for uploading pictures and videos
